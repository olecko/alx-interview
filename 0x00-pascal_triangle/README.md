# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years earlier. It is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single "1" at the top and expands downward with each row of numbers generated by adding the two numbers immediately above it. Here's how the beginning of Pascal's Triangle looks:

## Tasks
0. Pascal's Triangle

Create a function ````def pascal_triangle(n):```` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n:`

* Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
* You can assume `n` will be always an integer

```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x00$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
pascal_triangle = __import__('0-pascal_triangle').pascal_triangle

def print_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print the triangle
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print("[{}]".format(",".join([str(x) for x in row])))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_triangle(pascal_triangle(5))
