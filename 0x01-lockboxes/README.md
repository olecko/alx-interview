You have _n_ number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from _0_ to _n - 1_ and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.<br>
## General Requirements

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- Prototype: _def canUnlockAll(boxes)_
- _boxes_ is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers
	- There can be keys that do not have boxes
- The first box _boxes[0]_ is unlocked
- Return _True_ if all boxes can be opened, else return _False_
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04` LTS using python3 *(version 3.4.3)*
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Expected Output
```bash
@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ ./main_0.py
True
True
False
@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
```
